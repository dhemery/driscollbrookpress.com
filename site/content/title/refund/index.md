When Geoff Palmenter demands a refund from a master negotiator,
he expects an impossible negotiation.
Instead,
he wins far more than he bargained for: 
>
A second chance at love. 
>
And with second chances, timing is everything. 
>
A time travel short story from
[Dale Hartley Emery](http://dalehartleyemery.com/).
