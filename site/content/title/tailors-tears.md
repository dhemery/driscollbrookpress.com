"What does a girl have to do around here to prove she is a virgin?"

A tattered wedding dress.
An enraged bride.
And Clarke Whiteley is all out of virgins' tears.

He brought the problem on himself,
of course.
He should not have imbued Dulcie's wedding dress with magic.
Not with a maiden aura.
Not four days before the wedding.

And certainly not without conferring with Dulcie.

Now Clarke has four days to make things right.
But family rivalries are at play.
And deep family secrets.

And as Clarke is about to learn:
Family trumps magic every time.

A contemporary fantasy short story
