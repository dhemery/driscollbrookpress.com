Trapped in a funhouse in the sweltering Sacramento heat,
Mark and his little brother Davy
watch in horror as a zombie eats their friend.
Now they must work together,
one supplying the wits,
the other supplying the blood,
to find the doors to escape. 
 
But an even greater danger awaits,
and the search for the door becomes a race for survival. 
 
A horrifying, heartwarming story
about zombies and brotherly love
from [Dale Hartley Emery](http://dalehartleyemery.com).
