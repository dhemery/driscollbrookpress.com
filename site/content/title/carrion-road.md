Alone on an empty, eerie road
in the middle of the Sacramento Delta,
Carla fumes at the boyfriend who abandoned her.
The sun sets.
A car appears.
A pleasant looking couple offers wary Carla a ride. 

The fare: "Tell us the story." 

Not just any story: The story. 

But this is one story
Carla would rather not reveal to complete strangers. 

Or to herself. 

A contemporary fantasy short story
from [Dale Hartley Emery](http://dalehartleyemery.com).
