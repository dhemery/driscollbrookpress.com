"What does a girl have to do around here to prove she is a virgin?"
>
A tattered wedding dress.
An enraged bride.
And Clarke Whiteley is all out of virgins' tears.
>
He brought the problem on himself,
of course.
He should not have imbued Dulcie's wedding dress with magic.
Not with a maiden aura.
Not four days before the wedding.
>
And certainly not without conferring with Dulcie.
>
Now Clarke has four days to make things right.
But family rivalries are at play.
And deep family secrets.
>
And as Clarke is about to learn:
Family trumps magic every time.
>
A contemporary fantasy short story
