Yantriel lives on a small pig farm,
grieving the loss of his wife,
trying to make a good life for his two daughters.

Then,
on a midsummer day,
an endless mass of frogs begins to ooze out of Yantrielâ€™s outhouse.

Not just ordinary frogs.
These frogs know things.

Now the frogs set their sights
on the only thing Yantriel ever cared about...

His family.

A creepy fantasy short story from
