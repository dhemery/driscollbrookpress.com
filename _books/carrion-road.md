Alone on an empty, eerie road
in the middle of the Sacramento Delta,
Carla fumes at the boyfriend who abandoned her.
The sun sets.
A car appears.
A pleasant looking couple offers wary Carla a ride.

The fare: "Tell us the story."

Not just any story: *The* story.

But this is one story
Carla would rather not reveal to complete strangers.

Or to herself.

A contemporary fantasy short story
from [Dale Hartley Emery](http://dalehartleyemery.com).
