When Geoff Palmenter demands a refund from a master negotiator,
he expects an impossible negotiation.
Instead,
he wins far more than he bargained for:

A second chance at love.

And with second chances, timing is everything.

A time travel short story from
[Dale Hartley Emery](http://dalehartleyemery.com/).
