Fresh out of Folsom State Prison,
Jake Abbot craves one thing:
A thick, hot, juicy whiskey bacon cheddar burger

But traffic and a greedy cabbie
conspire to keep Jake from satisfying his hunger.

And when he finally arrives at Saint Florian's,
Jake's crimes comes back to haunt him.

Now,
pushed to the limit,
unable to escape his past,
Jake must decide
just how far he will go
for one good burger.

A short crime story
