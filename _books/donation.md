On a busy street corner in the searing heat of a Sacramento July afternoon,
homeless veteran Gene Garron
makes a seemingly simple promise
in exchange for a donation beyond his wildest dreams.

But a large sum of money attracts a great deal of attention.

The wrong kind of attention.

Attention that can make even the simplest promise hard to keep.

A short story
from [Dale Hartley Emery](http://dalehartleyemery.com).
