Norm Wheeler’s luck at the racetrack runs out,
leaving him deep in debt to a ruthless bookie.
When he tries to hire a rival thug to kill the man,
the negotiation takes a dangerous turn,
doubling Norm’s trouble.

Desperate,
with time running out,
caught between two dangerous criminals,
Norm must find the courage to settle his own debts once and for all.

A short crime story
from [Dale Hartley Emery](http://dalehartleyemery.com/).
